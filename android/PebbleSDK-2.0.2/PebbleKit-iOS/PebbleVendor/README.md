PebbleVendor
===

This sub-project contains all open-source software used by PebbleKit.framework.
It is maintained as a separate static library project. It is very likely that a third party application already includes one or more of the open-source files. In order to avoid and resolve conflicts in such a situation, the open-source parts are not built with the PebbleKit.framework but are provided as source and as static library archive.
